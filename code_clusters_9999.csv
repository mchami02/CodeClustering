The code includes different implementations of the RMSLE function using numpy and keras backend, and also includes some visualization libraries for plotting graphs.

The first two functions define the RMSLE calculation using numpy and Keras backend. The functions calculate the logarithm of the predicted and actual values, and then compute the square root of the mean square difference between them.

There are also two identical functions named 'RMSLE' which seem to have been accidentally duplicated in the code cluster. These functions also calculate RMSLE using numpy.

Additionally, the code includes imports for plotly, matplotlib for data visualization, and tqdm for progress tracking during iterations.

Overall, the code cluster appears to be related to calculating the RMSLE metric, implementing it in different ways using numpy and keras backend, and includes visualization libraries for plotting graphs."
